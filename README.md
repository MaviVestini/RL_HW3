# RL_HW3

Repository for the third homework for the  **Reinforcement Learning** course of the M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University.

## Topics
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- A2C
- DDQN+PER

## Content
- [document.pdf](https://github.com/MaviVestini/RL_HW3/blob/main/document.pdf), file where are listed the tasks to perform.
- [Theory.pdf](https://github.com/MaviVestini/RL_HW3/blob/main/Theory.pdf), file containing the responses to the theory's question and the explanation of the code.
- [assignment3/car_racing](https://github.com/MaviVestini/RL_HW3/tree/main/assignment3/car_racing) folder, that contains the code files:
  - [student.py](https://github.com/MaviVestini/RL_HW3/tree/main/assignment3/car_racing/student.py) python file that contains my implementation of the DDQN policy agent for the **CarRacing-v2** gym environment.  
  - [main.py](https://github.com/MaviVestini/RL_HW3/tree/main/assignment3/car_racing/main.py) given file used to manage the train/evalutation of the agent.
  - [auxiliary.py](https://github.com/MaviVestini/RL_HW3/tree/main/assignment3/car_racing/auxiliary.py) python file in which I implemented both the ReplayBuffer with prioritized experience and the Network class used to define the DDQN networks.
  - [a2c.py](https://github.com/MaviVestini/RL_HW3/tree/main/assignment3/car_racing/a2c.py) stand alone file for the implementation of the A2C policy agent for the **CarRacing-v2** gym environment.
